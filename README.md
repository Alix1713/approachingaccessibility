# Approaching Accessibility

This is a project about accessibility standards and how to refactor code to meet those standards.

## Getting Started

This code has been edited to meet accessibility standards that I found using google.

### Changes

Font size, color and style for visibility standards such as origional font was not standard for screen readers.
Changing some of the div tags to section, and em for important clickable links.
Changing the css to a simpler format so its easier to edit.
Adding alt tags to images
